When I was a little boy I started a specific interest in the universe, one of my big questions was about black holes. I remember that during a class at school I tried to understand it by asking a question to my teacher who told me that after the current class she will talk about it in detail with me, but it not happened, she had to start meeting with other teachers, but I had a lot of discussion during some classes with her about black holes I remember like today. 



### Black Holes

### Singularity

### Singularities and Black Holes
blah blah blah.
