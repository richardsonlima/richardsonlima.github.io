A bond so strong, a love so true,

Between a father and his daughter too.

A love that's unconditional, eternal and pure,

Forever felt, forever endured.


Through ups and downs, through thick and thin,

A father's love never wears thin.

A guiding hand, a comforting hug,

A love that's felt, like a warm snug.


A daughter's love, a father's pride,

A connection that nothing can divide.

A love so strong, it will never fade,

A bond that's forever made.
