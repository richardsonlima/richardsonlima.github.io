> The song's (On The Nature Of Daylight) immaculate slow build, the melancholy of its minor keys, the exuberance of the string section at the song's peak, all of this allows "On the Nature of Daylight" to lend poignant emotional resonance to any scene in which it's used- at least the shadow of it.

>I'm just imagine sitting on a rooftop terrace of a very cool place into the nature. You believe that I can hear cars and noise of the city, but it is just a ambient noise, nothing disturbing.

>It is actually kinda relaxing. I'm finishing my tea, working on my computer, listening to music. When this song start playing.

 >I can imagine a cat climbed onto my lap. Like so many times before, but this time, this time it felt like everything was exactly as it is supposed to be. Thereby I wish to all the people listening to this song to find their inner peace. You all deserve that.
