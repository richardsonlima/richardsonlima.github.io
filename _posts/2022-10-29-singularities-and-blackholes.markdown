When I was a little boy I started a specific interest in the universe, one of my big questions was about black holes. I remember that during a class at school I tried to understand it by asking a question to my teacher who told me that after the current class she will talk about it in detail with me, but it not happened, she had to start meeting with other teachers, but I had a lot of discussion during some classes with her about black holes I remember like today. 



### Black Holes

blah blah blah.

blah blah blah. 

### Singularity

In simple words a singularity is, a force of gravity that could compress you down into an infinitely tiny point, imagine you into it, hahaha! So you will occupy literally no volume. That sounds impossible, and it is. These "singularities" are found in the centers of black holes.

### Singularities and Black Holes

blah blah blah.

### Fiction and Time travelling

Dark is a German science fiction thriller television series ...

[![Netflix Dark - You are Me](/assets/article_images/24-7-e1588885277490-2124452654.jpeg "Netflix Dark - You are Me")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mloOTbcuB5I)

The **triquetra** is a three-pointed symbol that has been used in ancient Nordic, Celtic, German, and Japanese cultures. It has been used in both pagan and Christian religious imagery as well, symbolizing the Holy Trinity in the latter. It is sometimes interlaced within a circle or combined/interlaced with additional triquetras to form different geometric shapes like crosses, celtic knots, trikelions, and the three-hare symbol are all related.[1]

In the first two seasons of Dark, the triquetra seems to symbolize the caves' closed time loops with each year being thirty-three years apart, with the past affecting the future and the future influencing the past.[2] In the third season, it comes to symbolize the three different worlds as well.

This symbol is seen on the Emerald Tablet, the steel door in the cave leading to the passage, among the Stranger's papers, in the Sic Mundus photograph, on the leather notebook, and more.[2]

The **Emerald Tablet**, also known as the Smaragdine Table, or Tabula Smaragdina, is a piece of the Hermetica (Egyptian-Greek wisdom texts from the 2nd century AD), reputed to contain the secret of the prima materia â€“ the essence of all matter. It was regarded by European alchemists as the foundation of their art.
The line "Sic Mundus Creatus Est," which is written on the door to the wormhole, is derived from the text.

**Appearances and references**
The series features several references to the tablet. A painting depicting the Emerald Tablet by Heinrich Khunrath from 1606, with a triquetra added at the bottom, is seen in multiple places throughout the series.

**Interstellar movie - Landing in the Tesseract Scene**

blah blah blah.

> The most mind blowing part of this scene, is that even though he's looking through the back of the bookcase (at Murph), he still does not know that he's the 'ghost' that Murph had been experiencing, he's so taken back by the entire experience that he's completely unaware he traveled back in time. I've seen this scene about 20 times, and it still blows me away. Fucking GENIUS!!!! (by Christopher Banuelos)

> The incredible thing about this scene is that it could all be completely true - or at least partly. There is a credible theory floating around the physics community which states that at the singularity of every black hole lies a whole new universe. This means that our universe, everything we know and understand, could actually be the singularity of a black hole originating from a higher 'parent' universe. And at the centre of each and every black hole within our own universe, lies a new 'baby' universe born from our own. We would just never be able to physically see, let alone travel to these other universes because there is no possible way to survive the crushing gravity found inside the event horizon of a black hole. Mind = blown o.O (by Alexander McAllister)
