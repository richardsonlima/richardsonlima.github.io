Hey, professionally I'm a Platform Engineer (SRE, DevOps, DataOps), designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering in the cloud-native era. Working on an integrated product most often referred to as an “Internal Developer Platform” covering the operational necessities of the entire lifecycle of an application. Currently  doing my Master of Science degree at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology - [ITA](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/technological-institute-aeronautics). Dev with ♥ for Ops!

I'm a generalist with a focus on being a specialist (ha-ha-ha!), usually curious, fast learner, with some restricted interests and tend to like seeing the connections between several areas or understanding the bigger picture of whatever (High abilities/giftedness (HA/G), Asperger (SA) -  "high potential in any of the following areas, alone or in combination: intellectual, academic, leadership, psychomotor and arts.").

### Inspirational Quotes

> “Listen within yourself and look into the infinitude of Space and Time. There can be heard the songs of the Constellations, the voices of the Numbers, and the harmonies of the Spheres.”

> “The present issues from the past, and the future from the present. Everything is made one by this continuity. Time is like a circle, where all the points are so linked that one cannot say where it begins or ends, for all points precede and follow one another for ever.”

> “Quod enmim est erit semper” 

> “Close your eyes and let the mind expand. Let no fear of death or darkness arrest its course. Allow the mind to merge with Mind. Let it flow out upon the great curve of consciousness. Let it soar on the wings of the great bird of duration, up to the very Circle of Eternity.”
