Now it’s too far away and looking at the horizon lines distracts me, our dreams are what I miss the most when we looked together in the same direction.
Where are you now besides here, inside of me? We did it right unintentionally, It was time who got it wrong, It’s gonna be hard without you.

Because you’re with me all the time and when I look at the sea, there’s something that tells me that life goes on and giving in is foolish.

As you’re not here, What I can do is take care of me, I want to be happy at least. Remember that we planned on being fine?

I know that I do this to survive the pain, I let the wave hit me and the wind will take the pain all away.
