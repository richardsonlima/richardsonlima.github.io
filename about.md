Hey, Professionally I'm a Platform Engineer (SRE, DevOps, DataOps), designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering in the cloud-native era. Working on an integrated product most often referred to as an “Internal Developer Platform” covering the operational necessities of the entire lifecycle of an application. Currently  doing my Master of Science degree at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology - [ITA](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/technological-institute-aeronautics). Dev with ♥ for Ops!

I'm a generalist trying to be specialist (hahaha!), usually curious, fast learner, with some restricted interests and tend to like seeing the connections between several areas or understanding the bigger picture of whatever [6A02.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVBAYmY8slM). Into these areas I could highlight New Classic Music ([Hans Zimmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kottjfEd7Zw), [Ólafur Arnalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb34JCz5wvY&t=1213s), [Max Richter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_YHE4Sx-08), [Víkingur Ólafsson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3-rNMhIyuQ), [Stjepan Hauser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn1gcjuhlhg), [Ludovico Einaudi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70cfoPloJq8)), [Surf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyq_xRhSMTc) (I love the Ocean, Sea and Nature), JiuJitsu (Wellness, Discipline, Body Conditioning, Networking) and Drawing with Nanquim.

### Normally I take a look on books of these themes in literature:
- Business & Finance
- Personal Finance
- Astronomy    
- Mathematics
- Quantum mechanics
- Psychology
- Anime & Manga 
- Comic Books
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Cryptography
- Linguistics
- Space Exploration
- General & Miscellaneous Philosophy

As a guitar player by hobbie I've an specific interest in singers and musicians that makes Jazz, Folk-pop indie, Bossa, Progressive rock and Texas blues an incredible flavor of art. Then if you don't mind take a look into the list below and enjoy it.
