Never before I saw a woman

More pretty than you

Your beauty shines like the sun

Forever 'til the end.

Your eyes sparkle like the stars

And your smile brings me such mesmerized

I can't help but be mesmerized

By your grace and your poise.

I've searched across the world

For a beauty that compares

But none can match.

Never before I saw a woman

More pretty than you

Your beauty shines like the sun

Forever 'til the end.
