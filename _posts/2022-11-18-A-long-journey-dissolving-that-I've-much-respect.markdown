# A long journey dissolving that I've much respect

![Our dreams is what I miss the most](/assets/article_images/austin-neill-HAKTHWgeDWE-unsplash.jpg "Our dreams is what I miss the most")

Now it’s too far away, looking at
The horizon lines distracts me
Our dreams is what I miss the most
When we looked together at the same direction
Where are you now besides here, inside of me?
We did it right unintentionally
It was time who got it wrong
It’s gonna be hard without you
Because you’re with me all the time
And when I look at the sea
There’s something that tells me
That life goes on and giving in is foolish

As you’re not here
What I can do
Is take care of me
I want to be happy at least
Remember that we planned on being fine?

Hey, look what I found
Seahorses

I know that I do this to forget
I let the wave hit me
And the wind takes it all away
