When I was a little boy I started a specific interest in the universe, one of my big questions was about black holes. I remember that during a class at school I tried to understand it by asking a question to my teacher who told me that after the current class she will talk about it in detail with me, but it not happened, she had to start meeting with other teachers, but I had a lot of discussion during some classes with her about black holes I remember like today. 

### Black Holes

Black holes commonly known as **star killers**, typically when black holes are supermassive they kill stars by "spaghettification" in a process where the stars suffer from being ripped to shreds. Bizarre, right?

"The idea of a black hole 'sucking in' a nearby star sounds like science fiction. But this is exactly what happens in a tidal disruption event," the new study's lead author Matt Nicholl, a lecturer and Royal Astronomical Society research fellow at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, said in a European Southern Observatory statement (opens in new tab). Researchers caught the event in action using numerous telescopes, including ESO's Very Large Telescope and New Technology Telescope.

Black holes have been a subject of fascination and mystery for decades. These enigmatic objects in space are still not fully understood, and they continue to captivate astronomers and astrophysicists alike. In this blog post, we will explore the fascinating world of black holes and what we know about them.

![Black Holes - From Start To End](/assets/article_images/black-hole-92358__480-3304184125.jpeg#center "Black Holes - From Start To End")

Black holes are incredibly dense regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They are formed when massive stars collapse in on themselves, leaving behind a singularity - an infinitely small and dense point in space. Black holes have three main components: the singularity, the event horizon, and the accretion disk. The event horizon is the point of no return, beyond which anything that enters will be consumed by the black hole's immense gravity. The accretion disk is a swirling disk of gas and dust that orbits the black hole, heating up and releasing energy as it falls towards the singularity.

## Types of Black Holes

There are three main types of black holes: stellar, intermediate, and supermassive. Stellar black holes are the most common and are formed when a star collapses in on itself, leaving behind a singularity. Intermediate black holes are thought to be formed through the merging of several smaller black holes. Supermassive black holes, on the other hand, are found at the center of most galaxies and are thought to have formed through the merging of several intermediate black holes. These black holes can have masses billions of times greater than the sun.

## The Role of Black Holes in the Universe

Black holes play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies. The immense gravitational pull of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies can cause stars and gas to orbit around them, creating a stable environment for the growth of galaxies. Black holes are also thought to play a role in the process of star formation, as the accretion disks around black holes can heat up and trigger the formation of new stars.

### Singularity

In simple words a singularity is, a force of gravity that could compress you down into an infinitely tiny point, imagine you into it, hahaha! So you will occupy literally no volume. That sounds impossible, and it is. These "singularities" are found in the centers of black holes.

### Spacetime singularities

The concept of spacetime singularities is one of the most intriguing and mysterious in physics. These are regions of space where the laws of physics as we understand them break down, and our current theories fail to provide an explanation. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at what spacetime singularities are, how they form, and some of the known types of singularities.

## The Formation of Spacetime Singularities

Spacetime singularities are formed when the curvature of space and time becomes infinite. This usually happens in regions of space where the matter density is extremely high, such as at the center of a black hole or during the Big Bang. At these places, the gravitational forces are so strong that they warp space and time, causing them to curve and eventually collapse in on themselves. When this happens, the laws of physics as we understand them break down, and we are unable to describe what happens next.

## Types of Singularities

There are two types of singularities that are commonly studied in physics: point singularities and ring singularities. Point singularities are the most well-known and are associated with black holes. They are thought to be a point in space where the gravitational forces become infinite and where time and space come to an end. Ring singularities, on the other hand, are still largely theoretical and are thought to occur when a rapidly spinning object collapses. In this case, the object would become so dense that it would form a ring-shaped singularity, rather than a point.

## Implications of Spacetime Singularities

The study of spacetime singularities has important implications for our understanding of the universe. Not only do they help us to understand the behavior of black holes and the early moments of the universe, but they also challenge our current theories of physics. The existence of singularities suggests that our current understanding of the laws of physics is incomplete and that there is much more to learn about the universe.

### Fiction and Time travelling

Fiction is a genre that allows us to explore different worlds and realities that we cannot experience in our everyday lives. One of the most fascinating aspects of fiction is the ability to time travel. Time travel stories have been a popular theme in fiction for decades, allowing writers to explore different time periods and the impact of the future on the present. In this blog post, we will discuss the allure of time travel in fiction and how it has impacted the genre.

## The Appeal of Time Travel in Fiction

Time travel in fiction allows us to explore different eras and realities that we cannot experience in our everyday lives. It allows us to imagine a world where we can change the course of history or witness the events that have shaped our world. Time travel stories often involve complex plots and intricate details, which make them all the more engaging. As readers, we are transported to a different time and place, allowing us to experience history in a new and exciting way.

## The Impact of Time Travel on Fiction

Time travel has had a significant impact on the fiction genre. It has allowed writers to explore different themes and plotlines that were not possible before. Time travel stories often involve alternate realities, paradoxes, and other complex concepts that require a great deal of creativity and imagination. As a result, time travel has become a staple in the science fiction genre and has even made its way into other genres such as romance and mystery.

## The Future of Time Travel in Fiction

As technology advances, it is likely that we will see even more time travel stories in the future. With the rise of virtual reality and other immersive technologies, writers will have even more tools to create new and exciting time travel stories. Additionally, as we continue to learn more about the universe and the nature of time, it is likely that we will see even more complex and intricate time travel stories that push the boundaries of what we thought was possible.

The **triquetra** is a three-pointed symbol that has been used in ancient Nordic, Celtic, German, and Japanese cultures. It has been used in both pagan and Christian religious imagery as well, symbolizing the Holy Trinity in the latter. It is sometimes interlaced within a circle or combined/interlaced with additional triquetras to form different geometric shapes like crosses, celtic knots, trikelions, and the three-hare symbol are all related.[1]

In the first two seasons of Dark, the triquetra seems to symbolize the caves' closed time loops with each year being thirty-three years apart, with the past affecting the future and the future influencing the past.[2] In the third season, it comes to symbolize the three different worlds as well.

This symbol is seen on the Emerald Tablet, the steel door in the cave leading to the passage, among the Stranger's papers, in the Sic Mundus photograph, on the leather notebook, and more.[2]

The **Emerald Tablet**, also known as the Smaragdine Table, or Tabula Smaragdina, is a piece of the Hermetica (Egyptian-Greek wisdom texts from the 2nd century AD), reputed to contain the secret of the prima materia – the essence of all matter. It was regarded by European alchemists as the foundation of their art.
The line "Sic Mundus Creatus Est," which is written on the door to the **wormhole**, is derived from the text.

**Appearances and references**
The series features several references to the tablet. A painting depicting the Emerald Tablet by Heinrich Khunrath from 1606, with a triquetra added at the bottom, is seen in multiple places throughout the series.

**Interstellar movie - Landing in the Tesseract Scene**

The scene where Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lands in the Tesseract, a four-dimensional construct of space-time, is a mind-bending experience that leaves you questioning the very fabric of the universe. The visuals and the score are breathtaking, and the dialogue is thought-provoking. This scene truly captures the essence of the movie - a journey through space and time in search of a new home for humanity.


[![Interstellar - Landing in the Tesseract Scene 1080p HD](/assets/article_images/Interstellar-Landing-in-the-TesseractScene-1080p-HD.png#center)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJio07EtKYc)

> The most mind blowing part of this scene, is that even though he's looking through the back of the bookcase (at Murph), he still does not know that he's the 'ghost' that Murph had been experiencing, he's so taken back by the entire experience that he's completely unaware he traveled back in time. I've seen this scene about 20 times, and it still blows me away. Fucking GENIUS!!!! (by Christopher Banuelos)

> The incredible thing about this scene is that it could all be completely true - or at least partly. There is a credible theory floating around the physics community which states that at the singularity of every black hole lies a whole new universe. This means that our universe, everything we know and understand, could actually be the singularity of a black hole originating from a higher 'parent' universe. And at the centre of each and every black hole within our own universe, lies a new 'baby' universe born from our own. We would just never be able to physically see, let alone travel to these other universes because there is no possible way to survive the crushing gravity found inside the event horizon of a black hole. Mind = blown o.O (by Alexander McAllister)

### Curious about Tesseract?
In geometry, the tesseract is the four-dimensional analogue of the cube; the tesseract is to the cube as the cube is to the square. Just as the surface of the cube consists of six square faces, the hypersurface of the tesseract consists of eight cubical cells. The tesseract is one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes. __Wikipedia__


## Conclusion

Black holes are a fascinating mystery, and there is still so much we don't know about them. However, with advances in technology and the continued efforts of astronomers and astrophysicists, we are slowly unraveling the secrets of these enigmatic objects in space. The study of black holes continues to push the boundaries of our understanding of the universe, and we can only imagine what new discoveries await us in the future.
