>I'm just imagine sitting on a rooftop terrace of a very cool place into the nature. You believe that I can hear cars and noise of the city, but it is just a ambient noise, nothing disturbing.

>It is actually kinda relaxing. I'm finishing my tea, working on my computer, listening to music. When this song start playing.

 >I can imagine a cat climbed onto my lap. Like so many times before, but this time, this time it felt like everything was exactly as it is supposed to be. Thereby I wish to all the people listening to this song to find their inner peace. You all deserve that.
