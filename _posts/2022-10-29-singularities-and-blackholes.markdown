When I was a little boy I started a specific interest in the universe, one of my big questions was about black holes. I remember that during a class at school I tried to understand it by asking a question to my teacher who told me that after the current class she will talk about it in detail with me, but it not happened, she had to start meeting with other teachers, but I had a lot of discussion during some classes with her about black holes I remember like today. 



### Black Holes
blah blah blah. 

### Singularity

In simple words a singularity is, a force of gravity that could compress you down into an infinitely tiny point, imagine you into it, hahaha! So you will occupy literally no volume. That sounds impossible, and it is. These "singularities" are found in the centers of black holes. 

>There are places in the universe where our laws of physics simply break down

### Singularities and Black Holes
blah blah blah.
